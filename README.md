## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Borche ðŸš€
<p>A web developer with a passion for building dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications â€” and a background that brings a unique edge to every project I take on.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¼ I started my career as a mechanical engineer, gaining over two years of experience in team leadership and project management. That hands-on, problem-solving mindset naturally led me to tech â€” and for the past 18 months, Iâ€™ve been fully immersed in software development.</p>
<p>ðŸŽ“ I completed a Full Stack Development program, where I built real-world projects that solidified my skills across the entire stack â€” from database design to frontend architecture.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Frontend:
React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Radix UI</li>
  <li>Backend:
Node.js, Express, PHP</li>
  <li>Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose</li>
  <li>Knowledge of database design principles and E/R diagrams</li>
  <li>Cloud & Tools:
AWS (Certified Practitioner), Git, Postman, CI/CD basics</li>
  <li>Skilled in creating dynamic, responsive web applications and integrating APIs, including RESTful APIs</li>
  <li>Experience with Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies</li>
</ul>
